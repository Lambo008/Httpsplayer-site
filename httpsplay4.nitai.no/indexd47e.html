(On the other hand,) for a person who cultivates wisdom or true  knowledge, the results are inner peace, satisfaction, patience, respect  for others, freedom from duplicity, compassion, joyfulness, remembrance  of his spiritual identity, freedom from the fear of death, freedom from  anxiety and depression, and so on.

<p>The negative social results of a society populated primarily by hedonistic people should be obvious to anyone. A society of self-centered, animalistic people who have no other interest than their own sense enjoyment cannot be at all peaceful or progressive&mdash;either materially or spiritually.</p>

<p>(On the other hand,) the positive results of a society populated mostly by people who are serious about cultivating wisdom and spiritual understanding should be clear. If the citizens are peaceful, satisfied, respectful of others, compassionate, selfless, and so on, then society will be progressive both materially and spiritually.</p>

<p>The search for wisdom is a great challenge; to act on wisdom is an even greater challenge.</p>

<p>Every one of us continues to live, even though our childhood bodies have long disappeared. Your “baby” body and “childhood” body have ceased existing, but you have not ceased existing.</p>

<hr class="fancy" />

<p>The fact is that you know you existed five years ago, and you know you exist today. Although you still exist, you know that the body you had five years ago does not exist today. Therefore, you know that your existence is not dependent on the existence of any one body you may have on at any particular moment—whether it is a “baby” body, an “adolescent” body, an “old” body, or whatever.<br />
