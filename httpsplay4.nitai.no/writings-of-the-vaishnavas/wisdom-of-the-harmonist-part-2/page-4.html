<ol start="41">
<li>In the town of Nabadwip there was no end of students;
<br />All of them at noon went to the Ganges for their bath after study;</li>

<li>And the thousands of pupils of every separate professor 
<br />Engaged in mutual quarrels all the time.</li>

<li>In years but a child and of a restless disposition
<br />The Lord quarrelled with the students.</li>

<li>Some said, ‘your teacher, what does he understand?’
<br />Some boasted, ‘I will teach you whose student I am!’</li>

<li>In this way by degrees it became a quarrel
<br />Next ensued throwing of water at one another and thereafter sand.</li>

<li>Then there was fighting in right earnest every one beating whom he could,
<br />And mud was employed as a legitimate missile of war,</li>

<li>Some took prisoner their assailants in the name of the king,
<br />And some having thrashed their enemy slipped off across the Ganges.</li>

<li>The students displayed such an immense activity 
<br />That all the water of the Ganges was turned into a thick mixture of sand and mud.</li>

<li>The women were unable to fill their pitchers with water,
<br />The Brahmans and worthy persons found it impossible to bathe.</li>

<li>The Lord Biswambhar was exceedingly turbulent
<br />And in this manner made His way to every separate bathing ghat,</li>

<li>There was no end of students at every bathing place,
<br />And the Lord quarrelled with them at every ghat.</li>

<li>The Lord swimming with the current made His way to all the ghats
<br />And at each bathing place played for an hour or so.</li>

<li>Those who were reputed to belong to the class of superior students
<br />Intervened and asked what did they quarrel about?</li>

<li>Were they examining one another to find out the intelligence of each?
<br />Were they trying to find out who knew His <i>britti</i>, <i>panji</i>, and <i>tika</i> correctly?</li>

<li>The Lord said, ‘this is indeed, a grand proposal!
<br />Let any body ask Me any questions that he likes.’</li>

<li>Some one said, ‘why do you make such an excessive boast?’
<br />And the Lord retorted, ‘Better ask any question that occurs to you.’</li>

<li>That student put the question, ‘construe the <i>Sutra</i> of the verbal root’.
<br />The Lord made reply, ‘listen to Me closely as I explain’.</li>

<li>The Lord God is possessed of all power,
<br />He offered the true explanation of the <i>Sutra</i>.</li>

<li>Having listened to His explanation all praised.
<br />Then the Lord said, ‘Now listen to the refutation of the explanation’.</li>

<li>He then found fault with every item in the explanations.
<br />And asked any among them who possessed the ability to support them.</li>

<li>All of them thought within themselves that it was most wonderful.
<br />The Lord said, ‘Hear now I defend My explanation..’</li>

<li>Once again in such a manner did Gaur Chandra construe
<br />That it was excellent in every way and there was no defect anywhere.</li>

<li>All those who ranked as the best among the students,
<br />Every one of them, embraced Him to express satisfaction.</li>

<li>The students said, ‘Thou mays’t go home today;
<br />But must be also able to answer what we ask to-morrow’.</li>

<li>In this manner every day in the water of the Jahnavi
<br />The Lord of Vaikuntha did play pastimes that were mellowed by the exquisite taste of learning.</li>

<li>For the purpose of this sport Brihaspati possessed of all knowledge 
<br />Was born in Nabadwip with his disciples.</li>

<li>The Lord played in the water of the Jahnavi every day,
<br />And for fun often crossed over to the opposite bank of the Ganges.</li>

<li>The Ganges had of yore conceived many a wish
<br />Witnessing in the Jamuna the sports of Krishnachandra.</li>

<li>‘Oh when shall myself be blessed with the good fortune of the Yamuna!’
<br />Constantly did Ganga speak these words.</li>

<li>Although the Ganges is ever worshipped by Brahma, Siva and those under them
<br />Yet did she covet the state of the Yamuna.</li>

<li>Sri Gaursundar is the purpose tree that fulfils every desire;
<br />He fulfilled the desires of the Ganges all the time.</li>

<li>Having played in many a diverse way in the water of the Jahnavi,
<br />Gaurchandra returned home with high pleasure.</li>

<li>After worshipping Sri Vishnu as laid down in the Scriptures
<br />And having duly offered water to the holy <i>tulasi</i>, He sat down to His meal.</li>

<li>No sooner did He finish His meal than the Lord
<br />Taking His books retired to a secluded corner.</li>

<li>He prepared His own <i>tippanis</i> of the <i>sutras</i>;
<br />The jewel of all the gods forgot everything by the taste of books.</li>

<li>The high-souled Misra beholding all this swam in happiness
<br />And night and day was oblivious for joy of everything else.</li>

<li>Gazing ever and anon on the face of his Son
<br />Every day Jagannath experienced delights that no words can describe.</li>

<li>In such wise did the Misra drink the beauty of his Child
<br />That he realised union with the Divinity while he was still in this body.</li>

<li>For Misra’s external joys such as those of union with the Deity were as nothing.
<br />The Misra held as trivial the bliss of corporeal union with God and the like.</li>

<li>Manifold obeisance at the feet of Jagannath Misra
<br />Whose Son is the Lord of the infinity of the worlds.</li>

<li>In this manner the best of the Misras at sight of his Son
<br />Floated continuously on the sea of happiness.</li>

<li>The Lord surpassed the god of love in beauty;
<br />The grace of every several limb of His was beyond compare.</li>

<li>Misra noted all this and the thought occurred to him
<br />‘Some witch or demon might possess his Son.’</li>

<li>For fear the Misra made a surrender of his Son to Krishna,
<br />Lord Gaurchandra laughed as He overheard.</li>

<li>The Misra said, ‘Krishna, Thou are the protector of all,
<br />May Thou have Thy auspicious eye on My child.</li>

<li>‘Inside the home of the person who remembers Thy lotus feet
<br />No mishap ever makes it appearance.</li>

<li>‘In all those evil places that are void of Thy remembrance
<br />There abide witches, ghosts and the bad spirits.</li>

<li><i>‘Where, in the sacrificial performances, the demonscaring account of the Lord of devotees
<br />Is not listened to, there the evil spirits do abound.’</i></li>

<li>‘Thy servant, Lord, I am; to whatsoever belongs to me
<br />My Thou extend Thy own protection as all those are Thine.</li>

<li>‘Wherefore whatever form of mishap or misery there may be
<br />May none of those ever come near my Son.’</li>

<li>In this manner, constantly, with his whole heart and with uplifted hands,
<br />Prayed Misra Jagannath for the Divine favour.</li>

<li>It so chanced that on a certain day the worthy Misra had a dream
<br />Which detailed all this happiness and made him most wretched.</li>

<li>On beholding the dream he made a prostrated obeisance reciting a prayer,
<br />‘Grant, O Govinda, that Nimai may remain in my house.</li>

<li>‘This is the only boon that I beg of Thee Krishna,
<br />That my Nimai may be a house-holder and stay in the family’.</li>

<li>Sachi was very much surprised and asked,
<br />“Why do you thus all on a sudden pray for such boons?”</li>

<h4 style="text-align: center;">Taking Refuge</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>(Continued from P.24, June, 1928.)</i></p>

<ol>
<li>I have now understood that Thy feet, O Lord
<br />Are ever full of the nectar that dispells all fear and sorrow.</li>

<li>I have surrendered everything at Thy lotus feet:
<br />I have laid myself down, O Lord, under the shelter of Thy feet.</li>

<li>Thy lotus feet, O Lord, be my protection.
<br />No other protector have I in this worldly sojourn.</li>

<li>I know now that I am Thy eternal servant;
<br />The charge of my maintenance now belongs to Thee.</li>

<li>In the life that was unsubmissive to Thee I suffered much sorrow.
<br />All my miseries are ended by gaining those holy feet of Thine.</li>

<li>For gaining those feet Rama practised austerities.
<br />By obtaining Thy feet Siva attained his own well-being.</li>

<li>Thy feet fulfilled all the desire of Brahma.
<br />Narad Muni clasped Thy feet to his heart.</li>

<li>Thy feet that chase away all fear I hold on my head,
<br />And dance with the greatest joy and sing the praises of Thy feet.</li>

<li>From the perils of the worldly journey 
<br />Thy feet will surely deliver Bhaktivinode.</li>
