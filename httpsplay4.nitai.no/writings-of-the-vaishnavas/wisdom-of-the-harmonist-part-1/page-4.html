<h4 style="text-align: center;">Sree Sree Chaitanya Bhagavat</h4>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>(Continued from P.285, May, 1928.)</i></p>

<ol start="92">
<li>In this manner Misra with sublime patience approaching the Lord through knowledge
<br />By slow degrees quieted the faculties of the mind.</li>

<li>In this manner did Biswarup go out of his home
<br />Whose body is the same as Nityananda’s own proper self.</li>

<li>Who listens to the <i>sannyas</i> of Prabhu Biswarup 
<br />Attains devotion to Krishna and is freed from the noose of fruitive works.</li>

<li>Hearing the <i>sannyas</i> of Biswarup all the devotees 
<br />With mingled joy and sorrow thus constantly thought within themselves</li>

<li>‘Krishna has robbed us of the only place 
<br />Where it was possible to talk about Krishna.</li>

<li>‘We also will not remain here any longer, we will go into the forest.
<br />Where we shall not see the faces of these sinful people.</li>

<li>‘How bear the suffering of the words of the <i>pasandis</i>!
<br />All the people are constantly given to the un-righteous course!</li>

<li>‘In no one’s mouth hear such Name as Krishna
<br />All the world are in the agony of death being drowned in false pleasures.</li>

<li>If it is explained no one takes the path of Krishna
<br />But on the contrary even ridicules.</li>

<li>‘But serving Krishna what has been your happiness?
<br />You get your food by begging, this further increases your misery.’</li>

<li>‘It is not proper to live in the society of such people.’
<br />All of them breathed long-drawn sighs of grief saying ‘ Let us go into the forest.’</li>

<li>The generous Advaita consoled them —
<br />‘All of you will assuredly obtain the supreme bliss</li>

<li>‘I feel greatly rejoiced in my heart : —
<br />The thought comes to me ‘Krishna-Chandra has appeared.’</li>

<li>‘Let us all sing Krishna with the greatest joy.
<br />You will see Krishna in this very place and in a few days;</li>

<li>‘Krishna will sport in your company;—
<br />If this comes about Advaita is a true servant of Krishna,</li>

<li>‘Such high favour as is hardly obtained by Suka or Prahlad
<br />Will be the lot of even the servant of you all.’</li>

<li>Hearing these exceedingly honeyed words of Advaita
<br />The devotees cried aloud ‘Hari’ with the greatest joy.</li>

<li>With a thundering voice all the devotees shouted the name of Hari
<br />And the faculties of their minds were steeped in bliss.</li>

<li>Sri Gaursunder was at play with the children,
<br />Hearing the sound of ‘Hari’ He went into the house.</li>

<li>‘What brings Thee here, Darling !’—asked the devotees.
<br />The Lord made the response, ‘Why did ye call Me ?’</li>

<li>Saying this the Lord sped into the midst of the children.
<br />No one recognised by the force of His illusive power.</li>

<li>Since when Viswarup left home 
<br />The Lord became quiet for a time.</li>

<li>He was constantly at the side of His parents
<br />That the father and mother might forget their sorrow.</li>

<li>Holding Himself aloof from play the Lord minded only His books
<br />And never left off even for the fraction of a moment.</li>

<li>After the Lord read up a Sutra*
<br />He puzzled the boys over it.</li>

<li>Beholding such extraordinary cleverness all admired.
<br />‘All praise to the father and mother of such a family’, they said.</li>

<li>Much delighted the people informed ‘Misra,
<br />You have gained the reward of your good acts by having such a Darling.</li>

<li>‘There does not exist in all the three worlds another child with such good sense;
<br />He will surpass Brihaspati in learning.</li>

<li>‘He can construe everything as soon as He hears;
<br />His puzzles no one can un-riddle’.</li>

<li>The mother rejoiced listening to this report of the goodness of her Son;
<br />On the contrary Misra felt greatly depressed in his mind.</li>

<li>The worthy Jagannath Misra observed to Sacchi,
<br />‘This Son also will not remain in the family.</li>

<li>‘Viswarup, too, after studying the Scriptures in this fashion
<br />Came to know that this world is not true at all.</li>

<li>‘Realising the true meaning of all the Scriptures Viswarup, steady of purpose,
<br />Quitted this transitory world.</li>

<li>‘If He, too acquires the knowledge of all the Scriptures
<br />He will also go away leaving behind all pleasures of the world.</li>

<li>‘This son is verily the life of us both;
<br />If we do not see Him it will be the death of both.</li>

<li>‘Therefore He need not read any more.
<br />Let my Nimai be a dunce remaining at home.’</li>

<li>Said Sacchi, ‘By what will He live if He be a fool?
<br />No one will ever give his daughter to one who is so stupid.’</li>

<li>Misra said, ‘Thou art a simple daughter of a Brahman.
<br />Krishna is Slayer, Lord, Support and Protector of all.</li>

<li>‘The Lord of the world maintains the world.
<br />Who told you that learning maintains any body.’</li>

<li>‘Whether one be a fool or a <i>pandit</i> he needs must have the maiden
<br />That Krishna ordains, whatever she be.</li>

<li>‘Family, learning and such other matters are but minor indications;
<br />It is Krishna Who maintains all and is the strength of all.</li>

<li>‘Thou may’st see this directly in my own case:
<br />Why is it that there is no food in my house despite all my learning,</li>

<li>‘While the door-step of the man who cannot properly tell even his alphabet
<br />Is thronged with thousands of <i>pandits</i>? This thou canst easily see for thyself.</li>

<li>‘Therefore, it is neither learning nor such other things that provide maintenance.
<br />It is Krishna alone who nourishes and maintains all.—</li>

<li><i>‘How can death without pain and life without want
<br />Betide one who has never worshipped the feet of Govinda?’</i></li>

<li>‘Death with an easy mind and a life free from want
<br />Can be had only by serving Krishna and neither by learning nor wealth.</li>

<li>‘Save by the grace of Krishna there is no deliverance from sorrow
<br />Despite of learning, birth, or wealth that is counted by the crore.</li>

<li>‘Krishna perchance chooses to afflict with some great malady the very person
<br />In whose house there is the very best of enjoyments.</li>

<li>‘He is thus consumed with grief being unable to enjoy
<br />Such a person I deem more unhappy than one who owns nothing.</li>

<li>‘By this know that to have a thing does not avail.
<br />Touching everyone the command of Krishna alone holds good.</li>

<li>‘Therefore, have no anxiety for thy Son.
<br />Krishna alone will maintain the Boy, I say.</li>

<li>‘As long as there is life in my body
<br />He will not suffer the least sorrow.</li>

<li>‘Have not all of us Krishna as our Protector?
<br />Is there anxiety for one whose mother even is as loyal as thyself ?</li>

<li>‘I tell thee He does not require to read further;
<br />Let my Son being ignorant only remain at home.</li>

<li>Saying this the worthy Misra called unto his Son,
<br />‘Harken, Darling’, said Misra, ‘this is what I have to say.</li>

<li>‘For Thee there is no more reading from to-day;
<br />There is my oath if You do otherwise in this matter.</li>

<li>‘Dearest, I shall give Thee what-so-ever Thou mayst want;
<br />Remaining at home do Thou live in perfect weal’.</li>

<li>So saying the Misra went off to other work
<br />Lord Bisvambhar was deprived of any further chance of study.</li>

<li>Sri Gauranga-rai is Himself the old eternal religion.
<br />He did not disobey His father’s command and gave up going to school.</li>

<li>The Lord was grieved at heart for this break of the joy of study.
<br />He relapsed into His wayward ways in the company of the children.</li>

<li>He did not mind whether it was another’s house or His own.
<br />But smashed all things that came in His way and did great damage.</li>

<li>The Lord would not return home even after dusk
<br />For whole nights He played in divers ways with the children.</li>

<li>Covering up the body with a piece of blanket, with one other boy,
<br />The Lord went about in the likeness of a bull for fun;</li>

<li>And when by day He chanced to espy a clump of plantain trees in a house,
<br />In the guise of the bull broke it up during the night.</li>

<li>The inmates of the house would lament thinking it was the bull;
<br />He would bolt with the boys so soon as the master awoke.</li>

<li>He would bind fast from outside the doors of another’s house,
<br />So the owner could not come out to answer e’en the call of nature.</li>

<li>‘Hallo, who binds our door !’ they would exclaim much perplexed;
<br />And as soon as the master was astir the Lord decamped.</li>

<li>In this manner all night and day the Lord of the gods
<br />Played constantly in the company of the children.</li>

<li>However wayward the deeds that the Lord Viswambhar perpetrated
<br />The Misra ever maintained un-perturbed silence.</li>

<li>One day after the Misra had gone out on business
<br />The Lord being angry for the reason that He was not allowed to read</li>

<li>Sat Himself down on a pile of discarded earthen pots
<br />That had been used in cooking the offering of meals for Vishnu.</li>

<li>This is a very deep subject, so listen with undivided attention;
<br />By hearing it devotion to Krishna is matured.</li>

<li>Making a throne for Himself of all those refuse earthen pots
<br />And being seated thereon Gaur with His beautiful face went on laughing.</li>

<li>The soot from the side of the pots blackened every limb of Gaur:
<br />As if a charming figure of gold was besmeared with perfumed paste.</li>

<li>The children conveyed the tidings to Sachi,—
<br />‘Nimai is seated on the pile of pots’.</li>

<li>The mother saw for herself as she reached the spot and exclaimed with sorrow,
<br />‘My dear in such place it is not proper to sit</li>

<li>‘Those are refuse cooking pots ; one needs must bathe if he touch them.
<br />It is strange Thou art ignorant of this at Thy age’.</li>

<li>The Lord said, ‘you never allow me to read.
<br />How may a Brahman who is a dunce know right and wrong ?</li>

<li>‘I am ignorant and don’t know what are good and bad places.
<br />My knowledge of all places is one and undivided.</li>

<li>So saying He began to laugh seated on the throne of refuse pots.
<br />Presently the Lord lapsed in to the mood of Dattatreya.</li>

<li>The mother said, ‘Thou sitt’st in a foul place.
<br />By what method will Thou be cleansed of impurity ?’</li>

<li>The Lord replied, ‘Mother, you are very childish.
<br />I never dwell in any impure place.</li>

<li>‘The place where I am is full of all holiness;
<br />There abide the Ganges and all the sacred streams.</li>

<li>‘My purity or impurity is a fancy of the imagination.
<br />Consider well whether any offence is ever possible in the Creator.</li>

<li>‘Admitting a thing to be impure in the opinion of the Scripture or of the people.
<br />Can such impurity exist after it is touched even by Myself?</li>

<li>‘There has also never been any occasion for impurity with regard to these pots
<br />In which even thyself cooked for the offering intended for Vishnu.</li>

<li>‘The utensils used in cooking for Vishnu can never be polluted.
<br />By the touch of those pots other places are sanctified.</li>

<li>‘Whence it follows that I can by no means be in any impure place.
<br />The purity of all things being due to My touch.’</li>

<li>The Lord laughed in the mood of a child having thus declared the whole truth.
<br />Yet by the influence of His illusory power no one understood.</li>

<li>All laughed on hearing these words of the Child
<br />And Sachi said, ‘come away from that place, Thou needs must bathe.’</li>

<li>The Lord would not move and kept His seat.
<br />Sachi was insistent, ‘Be quick, lest father comes, to know’.</li>

<li>The Lord said, ‘If I am not allowed to read!
<br />Then be sure that I will never come down!’</li>

<li>All the people spoke ill of the mother of the Lord
<br />Saying ‘why, indeed, do you not allow Him to read?</li>

<li>One undertakes with all care to educate his son.
<br />What rare fortune it is when the Child Himself is so anxious to read.</li>

<li>‘What enemy has given you this precious piece of advice
<br />To keep the Boy at home in order to make Him a dunce?</li>

<li>‘In this matter no iota of blame attaches to the Child.
<br />‘Do Thou come down, Darling Nimai,’ said they,</li>

<li>‘If Thou art not given the chance to read even from this very day,
<br />Then shouldst Thou do all sorts of mischief in right earnest.’</li>

<li>The Lord did not come down but continued to laugh seated at that place
<br />And those people of pious deeds floated in the mid-ocean of happiness.</li>

<li>Catching hold of Him herself the mother at last brought down the Child;
<br />Gaur Chandra laughed like the dark stone scattering light.</li>

<li>The Lord told the Truth after the manner of Dattatreya,
<br />No one understood by the strength of the illusory power of the Vishnu.</li>

<li>Taking Him along Sachi of excellent deeds made Him bathe
<br />When Misra, possessed of a superior order of mind, appeared.</li>

<li>Sachi related to Misra all that had happened.
<br />That the Boy felt grieved at heart being unable to read.</li>

<li>The others said, ‘Misra, you are admittedly of a generous disposition.
<br />By whose advice you disallowed your Boy to read?</li>

<li>‘Whatever Krishna Chandra ordains must come true.
<br />Giving up all anxiety bravely allow your Son to read.</li>

<li>‘Luckily the Boy Himself is eager for study.
<br />So on an auspicious day invest Him with the holy thread in a suitable manner.’</li>

<li>Misra said, ‘You are the best of friends;
<br />What you have said are even as my own words.’</li>

<li>All people noted that all the deeds of the Child were extraordinary
<br />And felt astonished ; but no one realised its meaning.</li>

<li>Now and then some who were exceptionally fortunate
<br />Had already declared to Jagannath Misra–</li>

<li>‘This Boy is never a mortal Child;
<br />Cherish Him in your heart with all tenderness.’</li>

<li>The Lord ever sports in this hidden manner.
<br />In His own yard played the Beloved Lord of Vaikuntha.</li>

<li>By command of His father the Lord resumed His studies.
<br />And the Supreme Lord was most highly delighted at this.</li>

<li>Sri Krishna-Chaitanya is the Life of Nityananda-Chand
<br />At whose twin feet sings Brindabandas.</li>
