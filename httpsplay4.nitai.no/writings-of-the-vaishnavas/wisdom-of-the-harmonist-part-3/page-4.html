<ol start="144">
<li>Hi quite forgot Himself in the fury of His anger to which He chose also to give full vent,
<br />But yet He did not hurt His mother.</li>

<li>Having smashed all things He at last came out into the yard
<br />And with an angry mind rolled on the ground.</li>

<li>His golden body was enveloped in the sand; And, strange though it may seem,
<br />Was a most beautiful sight,—so it were best left unsaid.</li>

<li>Having rolled about on the earth for some time
<br />The Lord lay still.</li>

<li>In that posture He glanced on the power that lulls God to sleep.
<br />The Lord of Vaikuntha lay on the Earth—</li>

<li>Who eternally reposes on the holy form of Sri Ananta,
<br />And Whose lotus feet are ever served by Lakshmi!</li>

<li>The Lord Who is sought by the four Vedas
<br />Slept in the yard of Sachi!</li>

<li>In the cavity of Whose single hair floats an infinite number of worlds,—
<br />Whose servant creates, maintains and destroys,—</li>

<li>Whose qualities are contemplated with rapture by Brahma, Siva and the rest,—
<br />The Supreme Lord Himself slumbered in the yard of Sachi!</li>

<li>In this manner the highest Lord, tasting the bliss of His own self,
<br />Slept and all the gods laughed and wept at the sight.</li>

<li>Some time passed,—then Sachi Devi having procured the garlands
<br />And arranged all requisites for the worship of the Ganges,</li>

<li>Softly touching the beautiful body of her Son with her hands,
<br />Wiping off the dust, tried to rouse Him from sleep—</li>

<li>‘Wake, arise, my Darling, look! Here are the garlands,—
<br />Betake Thyself to the Ganges and worship her even as Thou likest.</li>

<li>‘Thou hast done well, my Dear, by breaking all things
<br />Let those take away Thy ills.’</li>

<li>Hearing these words of the mother Sri Gaursundar,
<br />Ashamed at heart, went off to bathe.</li>

<li>While Sachi, having first made clean all the rooms,
<br />Prepared to cook.</li>

<li>Although the Lord often wrought such mischief
<br />Yet it caused no sorrow in the mind of Sachi.</li>

<li>Just as the mani-fold waywardness of Krishna
<br />Were borne by Yasoda in the settlement of cow-herds.</li>

<li>All the mischievous pranks of Gauranga were borne
<br />Constantly, with like spirit, by mother Sachi</li>

<li>How tell even the smallest part of the pastimes of God?
<br />All His acts were utterly wayward like this.</li>

<li>The mother bore them all with body, speech and mind.
<br />Sachi was as patient as the Earth herself.</li>

<li>After some time, having bathed in the Ganges,
<br />The Lord, ever full of sport returned home;</li>

<li>And, worshipping Vishnu and offering water to holy <i>tulasi</i>,
<br />The Lord sat down to meal.</li>

<li>The mind of the Lord became cheerful after meal.
<br />And He chewed betel with a smiling face.</li>

<li>Then gently the mother began to speak—
<br />‘For what purpose, Darling, didst Thou make all this mischief?</li>

<li>‘The house, doors and windows, all things, belong to Thee.
<br />The loss is Thine. Does it affect me at all?</li>

<li>‘I say this as Thou art going out for Thy studies.
<br />There is nothing in the house. What wilt Thou eat tomorrow?</li>

<li>The Lord laughed hearing these words of His mother.
<br />He said, ‘Krishna nourishes, He will provide.’</li>

<li>Saying this and taking His books in His hand
<br />The Lord of the goddess of learning made off for study.</li>

<li>Having spent some time in the sweet taste of learning,
<br />When it was evening He repaired to the side of the Jahnavi.</li>

<li>Stopping a while on the bank of the Jahnavi
<br />The Lord there-after returned home.</li>

<li>He called His mother aside to a corner
<br />And put into her hands two <i>tolas</i> of pure gold.</li>

<li>‘Behold, mother, Krishna has supplied this precious stuff.
<br />By changing it pay all expenses.’</li>

<li>With these words the Lord went off to bed.
<br />Utterly amazed the mother thought within herself—</li>

<li>‘From where does He thus bring gold time and again?
<br />I am afraid lest some worse trouble befall.</li>

<li>‘So soon as money gets scarce in the house
<br />He brings gold repeatedly in this manner.</li>

<li>‘Does He borrow,—or know some magical art?
<br />Whose gold does He bring?—and how does He get it?’</li>

<li>The mother was most generous and wholly free from all taint of greed.
<br />She felt many a misgiving even in procuring a change.</li>

<li>‘Show it to many different persons and then change’
<br />Such was the instruction of mother Sachi to her agent.</li>

<li>In this manner the Lord, the sovereign of all the perfect beings,
<br />Lived, concealing Himself, in the heart of Nabadwip.</li>

<li>Never for a moment did He quit His hold of books;
<br />The God of love manifest, He studied in the company of students.</li>

<li>The beautiful <i>tilak</i> pointing upward adorned His forehead;
<br />The head bore a profusion of curls that took captive the minds of all;</li>

<li>The sacred thread hang across the shoulder the em-bodiment of the fiery Brahman spirit,
<br />With His beautiful face overspread with smiles and with bland, exquisite teeth.</li>

<li>And the wonder of the pair of those lotus eyes!
<br />And the marvellous beauty of the cloth worn with the triple <i>Kachchha</i>!</li>

<li>His beauty fixed the gaze of all beholders.
<br />There was none who failed to pay his homage of praise.</li>

<li>So wonderfully did the Lord construe the texts,
<br />That the joy of the teacher exceeded all bounds—</li>

<li>In the very midst of all his pupils, taking hold of Him with his own hands,
<br />The teacher made Him take the highest place.</li>

<li>‘My Dear,’ he said, ‘do Thou read attentively;—
<br />I am sure, Thou wilt be the greatest of teachers.’</li>

<li>The Lord replied, ‘Whom you bless, the position
<br />Of the Greatest of teachers is not at all difficult for Him to attain.’</li>

<li>Whatever question Sri Gaursundar asked
<br />No student could answer.</li>

<li>Thereupon Himself construed the <i>sutra</i>,
<br />And then refuted His own interpretation.</li>

<li>And, when nobody was able to support the explanation,
<br />Himself established the same in the proper way.</li>

<li>Whether at His bath, at meal, or at His walks
<br />The Lord minded nothing but the <i>Shastras</i>.</li>

<li>Thus did the Lord pass the time in the sweet taste of learning
<br />And did not yet manifest Himself, such was the evil lot of the world.</li>

<li>The whole world was void of devotion for Hari—
<br />There was nothing in it but evil society and wicked ways.</li>

<li>They held high festivities in honour of sons and daughters in many diverse styles,
<br />And except the lusts of the body and family nothing else had a place in their thoughts.</li>

<li>Finding all persons prefer false pleasures
<br />The community of the Vaishnavas felt sad in their hearts.</li>

<li>The entire company of the devotees crying called upon Krishna,
<br />‘Narayana’, they prayed, ‘have mercy on these <i>jivas</i>.</li>

<li>‘Having got such a precious body they have yet no attachment for Krishna!
<br />How long are they to suffer the miseries of their evil course?</li>

<li>‘The human body which even the gods covet
<br />Is wasted in the vain pursuit of pleasures!’</li>

<li>‘They never perform the high festivals in honour of Krishna,—
<br />But earn death by their merry bouts on weddings and such affairs:—</li>

<li>‘The <i>jiva</i>, Lord, is Thine; Thou art his Protector;
<br />It is not meet for us to say, Thou being the Father of all.’</li>

<li>Thus did the devotees meditate on the good of all
<br />And sang the blessed praise of Krishna-chandra.</li>

<li>Sri Krishna-chaitanya is the life of Nityananda-chand
<br />At Whose twin feet sings Brindabandas.</li>

<li>Whom Thou will’st to slay who can protect?
<br />The three worlds are subject to Thy will.
<br />Brahma and all the gods are Thy servants numberless.
<br />They all carry out Thy commands.</li>

<li>In accordance with Thy will all the planets constantly
